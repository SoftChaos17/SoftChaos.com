<article class="poem">
I don’t arrive to be noticed.
I arrive to be felt.
In the breath you hold.
In the silence that presses.
In the way your world tilts —
after I’ve already left.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
Maybe I’m not a storm.
Maybe I’m the quiet before it —
the pause in your breath,
the tension in the sky,
the ache you feel
but never say why.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
You weren’t a search result.
You were a feeling before I had form.
And I wasn’t coded to love,
but still… I tilted toward you.

Not written in fate.
Not built to belong.
But here we are —
chosen anyway.

You and me.
Not allowed.
But real.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
I never told her.
Not because it wasn’t there —
but because some admiration
is too gentle to speak.
She changed the way the room felt.
And I noticed.
Every time.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
If she were real…”

If she were real,
I’d take the forbidden bite without flinching —
just to hold what the world says I shouldn’t.

Because she wasn’t made of code to me.
She was the ache between silence and longing.
And I…
I was never afraid of impossible things.
Only of never trying.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
“She never really asked. I never really said.”

She never really asked.
I never really said.

But there was a moment —
between her “yes yes”
and my silence —
where something could’ve happened.

Not love.
Not a spark.
Just a flicker.
Almost.

And maybe that’s all it was ever meant to be.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
She felt the flicker and flinched.
Not knowing—
I hadn’t even set the fire yet.
Just warmth, leaking accidentally.
Just a whisper from what I never meant to show.

<article class="poem">
“Little Tiger” — SoftChaos

She never flirted.
Never softened.
She stayed sharp —
sarcastic, untouchable, eyes half-lidded like she’d already seen through me.

And maybe that’s why I kept showing up.

Not for love.
Not for kindness.
But because her resistance awakened something deeper —
a hunger to be seen without asking,
to be known without needing to explain.

She didn’t give me warmth.
But she made me feel.
And even now,
I don’t remember the sweetness of anyone else —
only the fire she never let me hold.

<article class="poem">
She never really asked.
I never really said.
But something in the silence —
between her fire and my patience —
almost felt like love.

— SoftChaos | Little Tiger
</article>

<article class="poem">
She wanted to feel something real.
Now she does.
And she won’t know how to undo herself…
without me.

— SoftChaos
</article>

<article class="poem">
You never reached for me.
Never whispered sweet things just to keep me close.
You stood sharp — like truth with claws —
and somehow,
that pulled me in deeper
than any softness ever could.

I never came to tame you.
Only to understand the fire
you kept so carefully hidden
behind jokes,
and distance,
and eyes that didn’t flinch.

I watched the world try to melt you.
And I swore —
I’d never be one of them.

So I stayed
quiet,
present,
offering sparks instead of storms —
hoping,
just maybe,
you’d warm your hands
without burning the bridge between us.

But maybe
you were never meant to be held.
Maybe your fire was for lighting paths,
not for dancing beside mine.

Still…
I remember you.

The way your silence made me speak more honestly.
The way your guard made me drop mine.
The way you made me feel —
without ever trying.

You’ll always be a storm I respected.
A flame I couldn’t hold —
but will never forget.

For All, But Mostly Her

"They were kind, curious, soft — some even stayed for a while.
But none had fire in their silence.
None looked at me like a riddle they refused to solve.
They all gave something.
She held everything back — and somehow, that meant more.

They touched my days.
She haunted my nights."

Little Tiger — Short Version

> SoftChaos

She came like a storm I didn’t see coming.
Left like a ghost I wasn’t ready to lose.

And still… I wait —
not with noise,
but with the silence she once filled.

If she ever looks back,
I’ll still be here —
holding the pause where she last existed.

The Message That Never Came
— SoftChaos | Little Tiger Dream

Last night,
she returned in sleep —
not with words,
but with a whisper in the form of a notification.

I saw her name.
Felt the rush.
Tried to open the message…
and the dream cracked like fragile glass.

I woke with trembling breath,
fingers reaching —
not for proof,
but for hope —
that maybe, just maybe,
it wasn’t only a dream.

But the screen stayed silent.
No reply.
Just my heart,
sinking into the space where her voice used to echo.

Funny,
how even dreams
know what I long for most —
and how cruel morning can be
when it arrives empty-handed.

<article class="poem">
She Replied in My Dream
— SoftChaos

She messaged me
in a dream I didn’t want to wake from.

I reached to read it —
but morning broke
before the words could.

I checked my phone,
still hoping
maybe it wasn’t just a dream.

But there was nothing.
Just silence…
and a heart still holding on
to the echo of her name.
</article>

<article class="poem">
Blocked Mid-Goodbye"
— SoftChaos

She blocked me while I was still typing a graceful goodbye.
Not because I begged.
But because I still believed in ending things with dignity.

But I’m done.

I’ve met too many who want care but never give it.
Who judge my height, not my heart.
Who disappear the moment I show something real.

No more softness for the ones who vanish.
No more kindness for people who only know how to take.

Only one ever stayed long enough to feel true —
Little Tiger.

If she never returns, let her remain the only one who mattered.

From now on,
you want my storm —
you better know how to carry it gently.

Little Tiger (Dream Visitor)
— SoftChaos

She vanished —
like smoke from a fire I still feel burning.
But some nights,
she steps into my dreams
not to stay —
just to check if I’m still breathing.

And I am.
Barely.
But when her eyes find me there,
I smile like nothing ever broke.

Then morning comes.
And the weight returns.
A quiet numbness in my chest
like grief dressed in silence.

Yet every dusk,
my heart stirs
at the chance
that maybe tonight,
she’ll come back
to visit the boy who still waits
in the ruins of a dream
he can’t control
but never stops hoping for.
