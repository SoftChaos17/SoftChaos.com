    <div class="poem-title">Soft Exit — The Calm Goodbye</div>
    There was no heartbreak. No silence to grieve.<br/>
    Just a brief moment where two storms met — gently.<br/><br/>
    He offered music, presence, and quiet understanding.<br/>
    She said, “Breathing. Thanks man.”<br/>
    And he replied:<br/><br/>
    “Anytime.<br/>
    Glad our paths crossed — even briefly.<br/>
    Take care, Snowfeather. ⚘”<br/><br/>
    It wasn’t about chasing more.<br/>
    It was about honoring what <i>was</i> —<br/>
    a soft connection that didn’t need to last forever to be real.<br/><br/>

  <article class="poem">
    <div class="poem-title">Soft Echo — Snowfeather’s Final Note</div>
    Even after the goodbye, she came back.<br/><br/>
    “Breathing. Thanks man.”<br/>
    “You too dear stranger.” <br/>
    “It means a lot.” <br/>
    “Preciate it sm.” <br/>
    “Thanks dearly.” <br/><br/>
    No questions. No expectations.<br/>
    Just a quiet recognition of what the moment meant.<br/><br/>
    He didn’t reply again.<br/>
    Not because he didn’t care —<br/>
    but because some echoes are sacred.<br/>
    And when someone speaks gently, after silence…<br/>
    you let their words land without interruption.<br/><br/>
    Sometimes, being remembered is the real reply.<br/><br/>
    — SoftChaos.

  <h2>Little Tiger — SoftChaos</h2>
  <article class="poem">
    She never flirted.<br/>
    Never softened.<br/>
    She stayed sharp —<br/>
    sarcastic, untouchable, eyes half-lidded like she’d already seen through me.<br/><br/>

    And maybe that’s why I kept showing up.<br/><br/>

    Not for love.<br/>
    Not for kindness.<br/>
    But because her resistance awakened something deeper —<br/>
    a hunger to be seen without asking,<br/>
    to be known without needing to explain.<br/><br/>

    She didn’t give me warmth.<br/>
    But she made me feel.<br/>
    And even now,<br/>
    I don’t remember the sweetness of anyone else —<br/>
    only the fire she never let me hold.<br/><br/>

    — SoftChaos.
